## Code of Conduct

All who work on this project are expected to be respectful of all other people along with their ideas and suggestions. Abusive behavior, harassment of any kind, or any sort of vulgar comments will **not** be tolerated. Please always be kind and reasonable when dealing with others. All who contribute to this project are expected to adhere to this code of conduct.

## TL;DR

If you have a question, I encourage you to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/yNQ9dW4). Please do **not** file an issue to ask a question.

## Guidelines

### How to Contribute

You don't have to write code to contribute to the project. There are many ways to help out!

#### Report a Bug

Before reporting a bug, please check that an issue isn't already open for the bug you found. Bugs are tracked as Github issues in this project. You need to fill out as much information as possible when filing a bug so that it can be hunted and squashed properly. Follow the Github template and fill out the information as requested. 

#### Suggest New Features

Have a good idea on how to make the app better? Please share! Before filing an issue however, it would be best to first discuss the idea on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yNQ9dW4) before filing an issue on Github.

#### Contribute Code

Arguably the best way to contribute is to submit a pull request (PR). Before doing so, please keep in mind the following reminders:

- **Respect the Style**: When making contributions please respect the existing coding style present in the existing code. PRs made to make sweeping changes to code style will not be accepted.
- **Commits**: Please be verbose in your commit messages. Limit the first line to ~72 characters and use good, long descriptions. I prefer too much information as opposed to too little.
- **Document you Code**: Large chunks of un-documented code will not be accepted. Please use comments liberarly where needed in your code and also provide proper documentation.

The general flow for contributers should be something like:

- Fork the project
- Clone locally (if needed)
- Create a new branch (`feature/my-new-awesome-feature`)
- Create commits and push
- File PR to `eventbus/develop` (PRs on `master` will *not* be accepted).
